# do_sqlite3

* <http://dataobjects.info>

## Description

A SQLite3 driver for DataObjects.

## Features/Problems

This driver implements the DataObjects API for the SQLite3 relational database.

## Synopsis

An example of usage:

```ruby
@connection = DataObjects::Connection.new("sqlite3://employees")
@reader = @connection.create_command('SELECT * FROM users').execute_reader
@reader.next!
```

## Requirements

This driver is provided for the following platforms:
 * Ruby MRI (1.8.6/7), 1.9: tested on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows platforms.
 * JRuby 1.3.1 + (1.4+ recommended).
 * Rubinius (experimental).

Additionally you should have the following prerequisites:
 * `data_objects` gem
 * `do_jdbc` gem (shared library), if running on JRuby.

## Install

To install the gem:

    gem install do_sqlite3

To compile and install from source:

 * Install rake-compiler: `gem install rake-compiler`.

 * For MRI/Rubinius extensions:
   * Install the `gcc` compiler. On OS X, you should install XCode tools. On
     Ubuntu, run `apt-get install build-essential`.
   * Install Ruby and SQLite3.
   * Install the Ruby and SQLite3 development headers.
     * On Debian-Linux distributions, you can install the following packages
       with `apt`: `ruby-dev` `libsqlite3-dev`.
   * If you want to cross-compile for Windows:
     * Install MinGW:
       * On Debian-Linux distributions, you can install the following package
         with `apt`: `mingw32`.
       * On OS X, this can install the following package with MacPorts: `i386-mingw32-gcc`.
     * Run `rake-compiler cross-ruby`.
     * Run `rake-compiler update-config`.

 * For JRuby extensions:
   * Install the Java Development Kit (provided if you are
     on a recent version of Mac OS X) from <http://java.sun.com>.
   * Install a recent version of JRuby. Ensure `jruby` is in your `PATH` and/or
     you have configured the `JRUBY_HOME` environment variable to point to your
     JRuby installation.
   * Install `data_objects` and `do_jdbc` with `jruby -S rake install`.

 * Then, install this driver with `(jruby -S) rake install`.

## Developers

Follow the above installation instructions. Additionally, you'll need:
  * `rspec` gem for running specs.
  * `YARD` gem for generating documentation.

See the DataObjects wiki for more comprehensive information on installing and

To run specs:

    rake spec

To run specs without compiling extensions first:

    rake spec_no_compile

To run individual specs:

    rake spec SPEC=spec/connection_spec.rb
